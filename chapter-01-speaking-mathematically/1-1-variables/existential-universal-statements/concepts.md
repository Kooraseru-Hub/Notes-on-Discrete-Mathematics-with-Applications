## Concepts

### Existential Universal Statement

An existential universal statement has two components:

1. **Existential component**: The statement asserts that a certain object exists.
2. **Universal component**: The statement asserts that the object satisfies a property for all things of a certain kind.

**Example**
`There is a positive integer that is less than or equal to every positive integer.`

* Existential aspect: “There is a positive integer”
* Universal aspect: “that is less than or equal to every positive integer”

**Key Idea**
Existential universal statements can be rewritten in multiple equivalent forms:

1. **Simplified version**
   `Some positive integer is less than or equal to every positive integer.`

2. **Variable-introduced version**
   `There is a positive integer m that is less than or equal to every positive integer.`

3. **Formal universal-existential version**
   `There is a positive integer m such that every positive integer is greater than or equal to m.`

4. **Property-focused version**
   `There is a positive integer m with the property that for every positive integer n, m <= n.`

**Importance of Variables**
Introducing variables (like m and n) allows precise reference to objects in proofs and definitions without limiting generality. This approach is essential for defining fundamental concepts in mathematics, such as limits of sequences.

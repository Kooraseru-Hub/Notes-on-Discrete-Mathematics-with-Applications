## Concepts

### Universal Statement

A universal statement is one that applies to all elements in a set. It usually contains phrases such as **for every** or **all**.

### Conditional Statement

A conditional statement relates two conditions and typically uses the phrase **if-then**.

### Universal Conditional Statement

A universal conditional statement combines the universal and conditional forms. It applies universally while having an **if-then** structure.

**Key Idea**
Universal conditional statements can be rewritten to emphasize either the conditional or the universal aspect:

* **Conditional-emphasized form**
  For example,
  `If an animal is a dog, then the animal is a mammal.`

* **Universal-emphasized form**
  For example,
  `For every dog a, a is a mammal.`
  or
  `All dogs are mammals.`

**Importance**
The ability to translate among these forms is important for mathematics and computer science. It makes reasoning about statements clearer and allows flexible expression in proofs and algorithms.

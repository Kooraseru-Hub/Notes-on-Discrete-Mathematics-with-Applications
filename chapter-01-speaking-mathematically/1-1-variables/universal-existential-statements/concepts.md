## Concepts

### Additive Inverse

For a number `b` to be an additive inverse of a number `a`, it means:

`a + b = 0`

### Universal Existential Statement

A universal existential statement has two components:

1. **Universal component**: The statement’s first part applies to all objects of a given type.
2. **Existential component**: The statement’s second part asserts the existence of something for each object.

**Example**
`Every real number has an additive inverse.`

* Universal aspect: “Every real number”
* Existential aspect: “has an additive inverse”

Different real numbers have different additive inverses, but all additive inverses are real numbers.

**Key Idea**
Universal existential statements can be rewritten in several equivalent ways:

1. **Simplified universal**:
   `All real numbers have additive inverses.`

2. **Formal universal-existential**:
   `For every real number r, there is an additive inverse for r.`

3. **Variable-introduced formal version**:
   `For every real number r, there is a real number s such that s is an additive inverse for r.`

**Importance of variables**
Introducing names for variables allows you to refer unambiguously to quantities throughout mathematical arguments, while remaining general and not restricted to specific values.

Example: After defining `r` and `s` as above:

* If `r` is positive, `s` is negative
* If `r` is negative, `s` is positive
* If `r` is zero, `s` is zero

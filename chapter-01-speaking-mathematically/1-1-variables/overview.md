# 1.1 Variables

## Introduction

A variable is a **placeholder** used when we want to talk about something but either do not know its value or want it to represent any value.

### Uses

1. **As an unknown**
   A temporary name for a specific number you are trying to find.
   **Example**:
   `Is there a number x such that 2x + 3 = x²?`

2. **As a universal placeholder**
   A symbol representing any value in a set.
   **Example**:
   `No matter what number n is chosen, if n > 2, then …`

## Existential Statements

### Definition

An **existential statement** asserts that **there is at least one object** for which a given property is true.

### Examples

* `There is a prime number that is even.`
* `Some real number x satisfies x² = 4.`

### Notes

* Existential statements are often expressed using the phrase **there exists** or the symbol `∃`.
* They contrast with **universal statements**, which assert that a property holds for **all elements** of a set.

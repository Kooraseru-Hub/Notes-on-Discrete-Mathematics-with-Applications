## Examples

### Example 1: Ordered Pairs

* Is `(1, 2) = (2, 1)`? → **No**
* Is `(3, 5, 10) = (9, 4, 36)`? → **Yes** (based on squared values given in original example)
* First element of `(1, 1)` → **1**

### Example 2: Ordered n-tuples

* Is `(1, 2, 3, 4) = (1, 2, 4, 3)`? → **No**
* Is `(3, (-2)², 1²) = (9, 4, 36)`? → **Yes**

### Example 3: Cartesian Products of Sets

Let:
`A = {x, y}`, `B = {1, 2, 3}`, `C = {a, b}`

1. `A × B = { (x,1), (y,1), (x,2), (y,2), (x,3), (y,3) }` → 6 elements
2. `B × A = { (1,x), (1,y), (2,x), (2,y), (3,x), (3,y) }` → 6 elements
3. `A × A = { (x,x), (x,y), (y,x), (y,y) }` → 4 elements
4. `(A × B) × C` → 12 elements, each pair from `A × B` combined with `C`
5. `A × B × C` → 12 elements as ordered triples

### Example 4: Cartesian Plane

* `R × R` corresponds to all points `(x, y)` on the plane.
* The first element represents the horizontal position, the second the vertical.

### Example 5: Strings

Let `A = {a, b}`. All strings of length 3 with at least two repeated characters:
`aab, aba, baa, aaa, bba, bab, abb, bbb`

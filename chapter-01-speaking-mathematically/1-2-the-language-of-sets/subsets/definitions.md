## Definitions

### Subset

A set `A` is a **subset** of a set `B`, written `A ⊆ B`, if **every element of A is also an element of B**.

Symbolically:
`A ⊆ B` means `for every x, if x ∈ A then x ∈ B`.

Alternative phrasing:

* `A is contained in B`
* `B contains A`

### Not a Subset

`A ⊈ B` means **there exists at least one element x in A that is not in B**.

### Proper Subset

A set `A` is a **proper subset** of `B` if every element of `A` is in `B` **and** there exists at least one element of `B` that is not in `A`.

## Concepts

Functions are a specialized type of relation where each element of a set, called the **domain**, is associated with exactly one element of another set, called the **co-domain**. Conceptually, functions formalize the idea of “mapping” elements from one set to another.

* Functions are relations with strict rules:

  1. **Existence:** Every element in the domain must be related to some element in the co-domain.
  2. **Uniqueness:** No element in the domain can be related to more than one element in the co-domain.
* Functions can be defined using ordered pairs, arrow diagrams, or formulas, and these representations are equivalent in theory.
* In computer science, this definition is particularly useful because it mirrors the way functions are implemented in programming: deterministic mappings from inputs to outputs.

A function allows us to assign a **special name** to the output corresponding to an input `x`. This output is typically denoted `F(x)` and read as “F of x.”

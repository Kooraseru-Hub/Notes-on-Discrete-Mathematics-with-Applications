## Definitions

### Formal Definition of a Function

> Let `F` be a relation from set `A` to set `B`. Then `F` is a function if:
>
> 1. For every `x ∈ A`, there exists `y ∈ B` such that `(x, y) ∈ F`.
> 2. For all `x ∈ A` and all `y, z ∈ B`, if `(x, y) ∈ F` and `(x, z) ∈ F`, then `y = z`.

Equivalently:

* Every element of the domain appears as the first element of exactly one ordered pair in `F`.
* No two ordered pairs in `F` have the same first element with different second elements.

### Function Notation

> If `F` is a function from `A` to `B` and `x ∈ A`, the unique element `y ∈ B` such that `(x, y) ∈ F` is written as:
>
> ```
> F(x) = y
> ```

This notation emphasizes the idea that `F` maps `x` to `y`.

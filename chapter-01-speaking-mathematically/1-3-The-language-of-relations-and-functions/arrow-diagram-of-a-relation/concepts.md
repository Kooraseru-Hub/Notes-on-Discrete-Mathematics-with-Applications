## Concepts

An **arrow diagram** is a visual tool used to represent a relation between two sets. It allows you to **see which elements of one set are related to which elements of another set** in a clear and intuitive way. This representation is particularly useful when the sets are small or when teaching the ideas of domain, co-domain, and the structure of a relation.

Key observations about arrow diagrams:

* Each element of the **domain** (first set) may have **zero, one, or multiple arrows** pointing to elements in the co-domain (second set).
* Multiple elements of the domain may point to the **same element** of the co-domain.
* Elements of the domain with **no outgoing arrows** are still part of the relation—they just are not related to any co-domain element.
* Arrow diagrams make it easy to **compare relations visually**, see patterns, and identify properties like functions (where each domain element has exactly one arrow).

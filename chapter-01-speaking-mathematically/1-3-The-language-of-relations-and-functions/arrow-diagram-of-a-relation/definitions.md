## Definitions

* **Arrow Diagram of a Relation:** A diagram in which the elements of the domain are represented as points in one region, elements of the co-domain as points in another region, and an **arrow is drawn from `x` to `y`** if and only if `x` is related to `y` in the relation.

* Symbolically:

  `Draw an arrow from x to y` if and only if `(x, y) ∈ R`, i.e., `x R y`.

* **Domain:** The set from which the arrows originate.

* **Co-domain:** The set to which the arrows point.

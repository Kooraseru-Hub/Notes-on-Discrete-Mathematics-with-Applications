## Examples

### Example 1.3.3 Arrow Diagrams of Relations

Let `A = {1, 2, 3}` and `B = {1, 3, 5}`. Define two relations from `A` to `B`:

* Relation `S`: For each `(x, y) ∈ A × B`, `(x, y) ∈ S` if `x < y`. This is the “less than” relation.
* Relation `T`: Explicitly given as `T = {(2, 1), (2, 5)}`.

**Task:** Draw the arrow diagrams for `S` and `T`.

### Solution

**Arrow Diagram Details:**

* **Set A (domain):** 1, 2, 3
* **Set B (co-domain):** 1, 3, 5

**Diagram for S:**

* Arrows from 1 → 3, 1 → 5
* Arrows from 2 → 3, 2 → 5
* Arrow from 3 → 5

**Diagram for T:**

* Arrows from 2 → 1, 2 → 5
* Elements 1 and 3 have no outgoing arrows

**Observations:**

* Multiple arrows can originate from the same domain element.
* Some elements of the domain may have no arrows at all.
* Arrow diagrams provide an immediate **visual summary** of which elements are related under the relation.

## Examples

1. **Sentences that are statements**

   * “Two plus two equals four.”
     This is a statement because it is true.
   * “Two plus two equals five.”
     This is a statement because it is false.

   Both sentences have a fixed truth value, even though one is true and the other is false.

2. **Sentences that are not statements**

   * `x² + 2 = 11`
     This is not a statement because its truth depends on the value of `x`. It is true when `x = 3` or `x = −3`, and false for other values.
   * `x + y > 0`
     This is not a statement because its truth depends on the values of both `x` and `y`. For example, it is true when `x = −1` and `y = 2`, but false when `x = −1` and `y = 1`.

Sentences whose truth value depends on variable values are called **open sentences**. Later sections show how such expressions can be transformed into statements by specifying conditions on the variables.

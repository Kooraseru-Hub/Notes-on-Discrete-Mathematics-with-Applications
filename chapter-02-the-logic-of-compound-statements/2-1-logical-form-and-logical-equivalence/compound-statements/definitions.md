## Definitions

> A **compound statement** is a statement formed from one or more simpler statements using logical connectives.

The primary connectives introduced here are the following:

* **Negation**
  `∼p` means "not `p`" or "it is not the case that `p`."

* **Conjunction**
  `p ∧ q` means "`p` and `q`."
  This compound statement is true only when both `p` and `q` are true.

* **Disjunction**
  `p ∨ q` means "`p` or `q`."
  This is the inclusive or, meaning it is true when at least one of `p` or `q` is true.

> **Note:** In expressions involving multiple connectives, negation is applied first. Parentheses may be used to specify grouping and override the default order of operations. Since conjunction and disjunction have equal precedence, expressions combining them must be parenthesized to avoid ambiguity.

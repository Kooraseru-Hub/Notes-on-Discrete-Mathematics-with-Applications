# 2.1 Variables

## Overview

In logic, an **argument** is a structured sequence of statements designed to establish the truth of a final claim. This final claim is called the **conclusion**, while the statements that support it are known as **premises**. For an argument to be convincing, its premises must either be accepted as true on their own or be derived from statements already known to be true.

A central goal of logic is to evaluate arguments not by what they are about, but by how they are structured. This distinction separates the **content** of an argument from its **form**. Logical analysis does not determine whether the subject matter of an argument is factually correct. Instead, it determines whether the conclusion follows **necessarily** from the premises. If the premises are true and the form of the argument is valid, then the conclusion must also be true.

Because of this focus, logic is often described as the **science of reasoning** or the **science of necessary inference**. It provides tools for identifying when reasoning is sound, regardless of the topic being discussed.

To analyze logical form independently of content, variables such as `p`, `q`, and `r` are introduced. These variables stand for complete statements rather than numerical values. Using variables allows different arguments with the same underlying structure to be represented in a uniform way, making it easier to recognize patterns of valid and invalid reasoning. Logical symbols such as “not p” and “∴” (therefore) further support this abstraction by expressing negation and conclusion without reference to specific statements.

By replacing meaningful sentences with variables, logic exposes the skeleton of an argument. This abstraction is essential for studying logical validity and for understanding why very different arguments can succeed or fail for exactly the same structural reasons.

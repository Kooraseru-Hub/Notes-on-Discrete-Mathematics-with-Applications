## Definitions

### Negation

> If `p` is a statement, the negation of `p`, written `∼p`, means "not `p`" or "it is not the case that `p`."

The negation has the opposite truth value of the original statement:

* If `p` is true, `∼p` is false.
* If `p` is false, `∼p` is true.

### Conjunction

> If `p` and `q` are statements, their conjunction is "`p` and `q`," written `p ∧ q`.

The conjunction is true if and only if both `p` and `q` are true. If either statement is false, the conjunction is false.

### Disjunction

> If `p` and `q` are statements, their disjunction is "`p` or `q`," written `p ∨ q`.

In logic, or is inclusive: the disjunction is true if at least one of `p` or `q` is true, and false only when both are false.

## Examples

### Negation

Let `p` be the statement "It is raining."

* If `p` is true, then `∼p` ("It is not raining") is false.
* If `p` is false, then `∼p` is true.

This relationship is summarized by the truth table:

* `p = T`, `∼p = F`
* `p = F`, `∼p = T`

### Conjunction

Let `p` be "It is hot" and `q` be "It is sunny."

The statement "It is hot and it is sunny" (`p ∧ q`) is true only when both conditions hold. If either condition fails, the whole statement is false.

Truth table summary:

* `p = T, q = T ⇒ p ∧ q = T`
* `p = T, q = F ⇒ p ∧ q = F`
* `p = F, q = T ⇒ p ∧ q = F`
* `p = F, q = F ⇒ p ∧ q = F`

---

### Disjunction

Let `p` be "`x < 2`" and `q` be "`x = 2`."

The statement "`x ≤ 2`" can be expressed as `p ∨ q`. It is true whenever `x` is less than 2, equal to 2, or both conditions are satisfied (in this case, equality).

Truth table summary:

* `p = T, q = T ⇒ p ∨ q = T`
* `p = T, q = F ⇒ p ∨ q = T`
* `p = F, q = T ⇒ p ∨ q = T`
* `p = F, q = F ⇒ p ∨ q = F`

These examples show how the truth values of compound statements are determined entirely by the truth values of their components.

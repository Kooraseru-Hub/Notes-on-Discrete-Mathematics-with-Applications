## Concepts

Compound statements are meaningful in logic only if their truth values are well defined. Since compound statements are built from simpler statements using logical connectives such as not, and, and or, their truth or falsity must depend entirely on the truth values of their component statements. Truth tables provide a systematic way to describe this dependence and remove any ambiguity that might arise from natural language usage.

By assigning truth values according to precise rules, logic ensures consistency and allows arguments to be evaluated purely on form, independent of content.

## Regarding Homeworks
This does **NOT** cover answers inside the homework due as that would be a violation of academic integrity. Please don't ask for me to include or go over Excercise Sets, or homeworks; instead, please go to the associated TA's (this is just a semi-public note page).

## Quick Notice
This mostly goes over material covered in the class whilst following guides from the eCampus textbook by Susanna S. Epp, with all explanations paraphrased or rewritten in the author’s own words.
Any referenced concepts are presented for educational purposes only. No substantial portions of the original text are reproduced, and any quoted material remains the property of its respective copyright holder and is included under fair use.

- I'm required to include this stub here, I'm not allowed to include any diagrams without completely remaking them so it'll be largely lacking of diagrams (sadly).

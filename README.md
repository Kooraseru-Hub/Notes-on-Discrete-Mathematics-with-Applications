# Summary on Discrete Mathematics with Applications
Personal study notes and simplifications for Discrete Mathematics with Applications, organized by topic and aligned with lecture material and textbook definitions.

## Quick Notice
This mostly goes over material covered in the class whilst following guides from the eCampus textbook by Susanna S. Epp, with all explanations paraphrased or rewritten in the author’s own words.
Any referenced concepts are presented for educational purposes only. No substantial portions of the original text are reproduced, and any quoted material remains the property of its respective copyright holder and is included under fair use.

^ I'm required to include this stub here, I'm not allowed to include any diagrams without completely remaking them so it'll be largely lacking of diagrams (sadly).
